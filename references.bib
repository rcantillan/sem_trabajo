	abstract = {The importance of networks in labor markets is well known, and their job-segregating effects in organizations is a given. Conventional wisdom attributes this segregation to the homophilous nature of contact networks, and leaves little role for organizational influences. Yet employee referrals are necessarily initiated within a firm by employee referrers subject to organizational policies. We build theory regarding the role of referrers in the segregating effects of network recruitment. Using mathematical and computational models, we investigate how empirically documented referrer behaviors affect job segregation. We show that referrer behaviors can segregate jobs beyond the effects of homophilous network recruitment. Furthermore, and contrary to past understandings, we show that referrer behaviors can also mitigate most, if not all, of the segregating effects of network recruitment. Although largely neglected in previous labor market network scholarship, referrers are the missing links revealing opportunities for organizations to influence the effects of network recruitment.

	abstract = {Current scholarship commonly posits that network recruitment contributes to job sex segregation and that the segregated nature of personal contact networks explains this effect. A variety of empirical findings inconsistent with this explanation demonstrate its inadequacy. Building on Kanter’s observation that recruitment processes often resemble “homosocial reproduction” [Kanter {RM} (1977) Men and Women of the Corporation (Basic Books, New York)], we develop a population dynamics model of network recruitment. The resulting formal model builds a parsimonious theory regarding the segregating effects of network recruitment, resolving the puzzles and inconsistencies revealed by recent empirical findings. This revised theory also challenges conventional understandings of how network recruitment segregates: in isolation, network recruitment—even with segregated networks—is more likely to desegregate rather than segregate. Network recruitment segregates primarily through its interactions with other supply-side (e.g., gendered self-sorting) or demand-side (e.g., gendered referring rates) biasing mechanisms. Our model reveals whether and to what extent network recruitment segregates or desegregates, and it reveals opportunities for organizational intervention. There is an easily calculable tipping point where demand-side factors such as gender differences in referring can counteract and neutralize other segregating effects from referring. Independent of other personnel practices, organizational policies affecting employees’ referring behaviors can tip the balance to determine whether network recruitment serves as a segregating or desegregating force. We ground our model empirically using three organizational cases.},

However, we know little about how teachers use their networks to find jobs, particularly in increasingly fragmented local labor markets. We draw on interviews with 127 teachers in three districts chosen to reflect an increasing presence of charter schools: New Orleans, Detroit, and San Antonio. We find that the extent of fragmentation in a city’s labor market drives the use of networks, with important implications for job access and equity.},

	abstract = {The concept of contagion has steadily expanded from its original grounding in epidemic disease to describe a vast array of processes that spread across networks, notably social phenomena such as fads, political opinions, the adoption of new technologies, and financial decisions. Traditional models of social contagion have been based on physical analogies with biological contagion, in which the probability that an individual is affected by the contagion grows monotonically with the size of his or her “contact neighborhood”—the number of affected individuals with whom he or she is in contact. Whereas this contact neighborhood hypothesis has formed the underpinning of essentially all current models, it has been challenging to evaluate it due to the difficulty in obtaining detailed data on individual network neighborhoods during the course of a large-scale contagion process. Here we study this question by analyzing the growth of Facebook, a rare example of a social process with genuinely global adoption. We find that the probability of contagion is tightly controlled by the number of connected components in an individual's contact neighborhood, rather than by the actual size of the neighborhood. Surprisingly, once this “structural diversity” is controlled for, the size of the contact neighborhood is in fact generally a negative predictor of contagion. More broadly, our analysis shows how data at the size and resolution of the Facebook network make possible the identification of subtle structural signals that go undetected at smaller scales yet hold pivotal predictive roles for the outcomes of social processes.},

While evidence of this type of assortative mixing and temporal clustering of behaviors among linked nodes is used to support claims of peer influence and social contagion in networks, homophily may also explain such evidence. Here we develop a dynamic matched sample estimation framework to distinguish influence and homophily effects in dynamic networks, and we apply this framework to a global instant messaging network of 27.4 million users, using data on the day-by-day adoption of a mobile service application and users' longitudinal behavioral, demographic, and geographic data. We find that previous methods overestimate peer influence in product adoption decisions in this network by 300–700\%, and that homophily explains {\textgreater}50\% of the perceived behavioral contagion. These findings and methods are essential to both our understanding of the mechanisms that drive contagions in networks and our knowledge of how to propagate or combat them in domains as diverse as epidemiology, marketing, development economics, and public health.},

Much research has found, however, that minorities do worse when they use personal networks in job finding. Research in this area has been hampered by the complicated and multi-step nature of the job-finding process and by the lack of appropriate comparison data for demonstrating the various ways in which minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities. We seek to specify what it means to say that minorities are cut off from job networks. Building on the literature on social networks in the labor market, we delineate the various mechanisms by which minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities. We examine how these mechanisms operate, using unique data on the chain of network contacts that funnel to an employer offering desirable jobs. We find that network factors operate at several stages of the recruitment process. We find scant evidence, however, that these network factors serve to cut off minorities from employment in this setting. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and methodological implications of the case for the study of networks, race, and hiring.},

Surely one of the most important has to do with the processes by which individuals become located, or locate themselves, in positions in the hierarchy comprising the system. At one extreme we can imagine that the circumstances of a person’s birth—including the person’s sex and the perfectly predictable sequence of age levels through which he is destined to pass—suffice to assign him unequivocally to a ranked status in a hierarchical system. At the opposite extreme his prospective adult status would be wholly problematic and contingent at the time of birth. Such status would become entirely determinate only as adulthood was reached, and solely as a consequence of his own actions taken freely—that is, in the absence of any constraint deriving from the circumstances of his birth or rearing. Such a pure achievement system is, of course, hypothetical, in much the same way that motion without friction is a purely hypothetical possibility in the physical world. Whenever the stratification system of any moderately large and complex society is described, it is seen to involve both ascriptive and achievement principles.},

Research in social science has provided a formal basis for the segregative outcomes resulting from the residential selection process and simulations have replicated relevant spatial outcomes under different specifications of the residential dynamics. New and increasingly detailed survey data on preferences demonstrates the embeddedness of the Schelling selection process in the social behaviors of choosing alternative residential compositions. It also demonstrates that, in the multicultural context, seemingly mild preferences for living with similar neighbors carry the potential to be strong determinants for own race selectivity and residential segregation.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an analytical framework within which hypotheses of class structure are brought to bear directly in the formulation of models for the occupational mobility table. The proper aggregation of rows and columns is portrayed as the fundamental theoretical issue in mobility table analysis, rather than as an exogenous "given" to be decided upon prior to the construction of explicit models. Homogeneity of mobility within and between classes, class hierarchy, and tangible boundedness are the central themes. These themes are implemented in loglinear models and applied in the analysis of large 17-category), intergenerational mobility tables. Four such tables from the studies of Blau and Duncan and of Featherman and Hauser are fitted acceptably. Seven falsifiable hypotheses about the social class structure of occupational mobility are identified and assessed comparatively within the new framework.},

In line with Max Weber, our research is based on the notion that, if class boundaries do not inhibit social mobility then the class categories are of little value. Thus, unlike dominant, theoretically defined class schemes, this article derives social class categories from observed patterns in a mobility network covering intra-generational mobility. The network is based on a mobility table of 109 occupational categories tied together by 1,590,834 job shifts on the Danish labour market 2001–2007. The number of categories are reduced from 109 to 34 by applying a new clustering algorithm specifically designed for the study of mobility tables ({MONECA}). These intra-generational social class categories are related to the central discussions of gender, income, education and political action by providing empirical evidence of strong patterns of intra-generational class divisions along these lines.},

However, this emergent cultural diversity has proven to be unstable in the face of cultural drift—small errors or innovations that allow cultures to change from within. The authors develop a model of cultural differentiation that combines the traditional mechanisms of homophily and influence with a third mechanism of network homophily, in which network structure co-evolves with cultural interaction. Results show that in certain regions of the parameter space, these co-evolutionary dynamics can lead to patterns of cultural diversity that are stable in the presence of cultural drift.

	abstract = {The present study uses data from the first wave of an ongoing panel survey study to test some hypotheses derived from Peter M. Blau's macro structural theory of social integration. More specifically, the tests reported in this article focus on the effects of heterogeneity on the rate of intergroup relations. According to Blau, an increase in heterogeneity contributes to an increase in social integration as measured by the rate of intergroup relations, so the more a community is differentiated by gender, the more male-female friendships there are. Blau also predicted that the effect of heterogeneity is weakened when differences along multiple lines overlap, so when gender is correlated with occupation and friends are chosen with respect to gender, there are fewer friendships between members of different occupations than there would be if gender and occupation were independent. I test these predictions against the data from the Polish Panel Survey {POLPAN}; its first wave was carried out in 1988 on a random and nationwide sample of 5,817 people ages twenty-one to sixty-five. The tests reported in this study use a version of Blau's theory developed by Thomas J. Fararo and John Skvoretz, who translated the original theory into a mathematical equation. The results of the tests raise doubts as to whether the theory is an accurate description of the relationship between social differentiation and integration. More specifically, the rates of marital and friendship ties with respect to several dimensions of differentiation\&\#x2014;such as education or occupation\&\#x2014;turn out not to be predicted adequately by the models developed by Fararo and Skvoretz.},

This essay proposes that studies of the micro–macro link in social systems can utilize conceptual representations and analytical strategies from the field of social networks. In particular, statistical network models and research strategies from agent-based network modeling can be combined to investigate dynamics and the emergence of structure. An empirical case study illustrates how stochastic actor-oriented models can be applied as empirically calibrated agent-based simulations. The fruitfulness of this approach is demonstrated by a Schelling-inspired case study on the emergence of segregation in social networks. It is shown that even individuals without homophilous preferences may find themselves in segregated structures due to the complex interaction of different network mechanisms. The example thereby illustrates how social networks can serve as a conceptual and analytical framework to study the micro–macro link in dynamic, interdependent, and multi-mechanistic social systems.},

At the same time, we know very little about how the contexts in which relationships are formed shape individual-level and group-level networks. This leaves our understanding of network-based mechanisms of inequality separate from the contexts in which relationships are formed and operate. This chapter sets forth a model that combines context, ego and global network structure, and inequality arising from network effects into one causal chain. We review evidence on how different characteristics of context – population size and composition, number and kinds of social foci, and organizational practices – contribute to the structure of social networks. We then review research demonstrating how those network features, as well as the overall structure of relationships, contribute to distributions of outcomes in the population. The chapter concludes with applications of the model using examples from student behavior in schools and from evidence about migration. We suggest that network scholars and scholars of inequality build this more expansive perspective into their work in order to better understand mechanisms of inequality.},

Analytical sociology explains important social facts such as network structures, patterns of residential segregation, typical beliefs, cultural tastes, and common ways of acting. It does so by detailing in clear and precise ways the mechanisms through which social facts are brought about. This introductory chapter discusses some of the fundamentals of analytical sociology, with particular emphasis on two interrelated aspects: the explanatory principles guiding the approach and the type of explanatory factors being evoked. It first describes what is meant by a ‘mechanism‘ and a ‘mechanism-based explanation’ before turning to structural individualism, a methodological doctrine according to which social facts should be explained as the intended or unintended outcomes of individuals’ actions. It also present various examples to make the abstract principles more concrete and concludes with a brief overview of the book’s organization.},

Reporting little evidence of mass polarization, previous studies assume polarization is evidenced via the amplification of existing political alignments. This article considers a different pathway: polarization occurring via social, cultural, and political alignments coming to encompass an increasingly diverse array of opinions and attitudes. The study uses 44 years of data from the General Social Survey representing opinions and attitudes across a wide array of domains as elements in an evolving belief network. Analyses of this network produce evidence that mass polarization has increased via a process of belief consolidation, entailing the collapse of previously cross-cutting alignments, thus creating increasingly broad and encompassing clusters organized around cohesive packages of beliefs. Further, the increasing salience of political ideology and partisanship only partly explains this trend. The structure of U.S. opinion has shifted in ways suggesting troubling implications for proponents of political and social pluralism.},

Moreover, most ideological differences in lifestyle cannot be explained by demographic covariates alone. The authors propose a surprisingly simple solution to the puzzle of lifestyle politics. Computational experiments show how the self-reinforcing dynamics of homophily and influence dramatically amplify even very small elective affinities between lifestyle and ideology, producing a stereotypical world of “latte liberals” and “bird-hunting conservatives” much like the one in which we live.},

	abstract = {An important puzzle in social network research is to explain how macro-level structures emerge from micro-level network processes. Explaining the emergence and stability of structural groups in social networks is particularly difficult for two reasons. First, because groups are characterized both by high connectedness within (group cohesion) and lack of connectedness between them (group boundaries). Second, because a large number of theoretical micro-level network processes contribute to their emergence. We argue that traditional social network theories that are concerned with the evolution of positive relations (forces of attraction) are not sufficient to explain the emergence of groups because they lack mechanisms explaining the emergence of group boundaries. Models that additionally account for the evolution of negative ties (forces of repulsion) may be better suited to explain the emergence and stability of groups. We build a theoretical model and illustrate its usefulness by fitting stochastic actor-oriented models ({SAOMs}) to empirical data of co-evolving networks of friendship and dislike among 479 secondary-school students. The {SAOMs} include a number of newly developed effects expressing the co-evolution between positive and negative ties. We then simulate networks from the estimated models to explore the micro-macro link. We find that a model that considers forces of attraction and repulsion simultaneously is better at explaining groups in social networks. In the long run, however, the empirically informed simulations generate networks that are too stylized to be realistic, raising further questions about model degeneracy and time heterogeneity of group processes.},

            This study contributes to the debate on whether income inequality is harmful for health by addressing several analytical weaknesses of previous studies. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in combination with tract-level measures of income inequality in the United States, we estimate the effects of differential exposure to income inequality during three decades of the life course on mortality. Our study is among the first to consider the implications of income inequality within U.S. tracts for mortality using longitudinal and individual-level data. In addition, we improve upon prior work by accounting for the dynamic relationship between local areas and individuals' health, using marginal structural models to account for changes in exposure to local income inequality. In contrast to other studies that found no significant relation between income inequality and mortality, we find that recent exposure to higher local inequality predicts higher relative risk of mortality among individuals at ages 45 or older.},

Using an agent-based model, this article shows that prior findings linking homophily to segregated social ties and to differential diffusion outcomes are contingent on high levels of consolidation. Homophily, under low consolidation, is not sufficient to exacerbate existing differences in adoption probabilities across groups and can even end up alleviating intergroup inequality by facilitating diffusion.},

Critical mass theorists argue that this ‘large group problem’ can be solved by an initial critical mass of contributors, whose efforts can produce a ‘bandwagon’ effect, making cooperation rational for the remaining members of the population. However, critical mass theory requires an explanation of how a critical mass can form in the first place. I present a model of collective action that solves this problem by showing how aspects of social structure – including network topology, homophily, and local coalition formation – can allow rational actors to endogenously form a critical mass. The findings indicate that as the mobilization effort becomes more ‘complex’, clustered networks and homophily become increasingly important for critical mass collective action.},

            How does the composition of a population affect the adoption of health behaviors and innovations? Homophily—similarity of social contacts—can increase dyadic-level influence, but it can also force less healthy individuals to interact primarily with one another, thereby excluding them from interactions with healthier, more influential, early adopters. As a result, an important network-level effect of homophily is that the people who are most in need of a health innovation may be among the least likely to adopt it. Despite the importance of this thesis, confounding factors in observational data have made it difficult to test empirically. We report results from a controlled experimental study on the spread of a health innovation through fixed social networks in which the level of homophily was independently varied. We found that homophily significantly increased overall adoption of a new health behavior, especially among those most in need of it.},

To evaluate approaches to causal inference in egocentric network data, this article uses three waves from the University of California Berkeley Social Networks Study (N = 1,159) to investigate connections between nine network variables and two global health outcomes. We compare three modeling strategies: cross-sectional ordinary least squares regression, regression with lagged dependent variables ({LDVs}), and hybrid fixed and random effects models. Results suggest that cross-sectional and {LDV} models may overestimate the causal effects of networks on health because hybrid models show that network–health associations operate primarily between individuals, as opposed to network changes causing within-individual changes in health. These findings demonstrate uses of panel data that may advance scholarship on networks and health and suggest that causal effects of network support on health may be more limited than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Polarization on various issues has increased in many Western democracies over the last decades, leading to divergent beliefs, preferences, and behaviors within societies. We develop a model to investigate the effects of polarization on the likelihood that a society will coordinate on a welfare-improving action in a context in which collective benefits are acquired only if enough individuals take that action. We examine the impacts of different manifestations of polarization: heterogeneity of preferences, segregation of the social network, and the interaction between the two. In this context, heterogeneity captures differential perceived benefits from coordinating, which can lead to different intentions and sensitivity regarding the intentions of others. Segregation of the social network can create a bottleneck in information flows about others’ preferences, as individuals may base their decisions only on their close neighbors. Additionally, heterogeneous preferences can be evenly distributed in the population or clustered in the local network, respectively reflecting or systematically departing from the views of the broader society. The model predicts that heterogeneity of preferences alone is innocuous and it can even be beneficial, while segregation can hamper coordination, mainly when local networks distort the distribution of valuations. We base these results on a multimethod approach including an online group experiment with 750 individuals. We randomize the range of valuations associated with different choice options and the information respondents have about others. The experimental results reinforce the idea that, even in a situation in which all could stand to gain from coordination, polarization can impede social progress.},

New social movements, technologies, and public-health initiatives often struggle to take off, yet many diseases disperse rapidly without issue. Can the lessons learned from the viral diffusion of diseases be used to improve the spread of beneficial behaviors and innovations? In How Behavior Spreads, Damon Centola presents over a decade of original research examining how changes in societal behavior--in voting, health, technology, and finance--occur and the ways social networks can be used to influence how they propagate. Centola's startling findings show that the same conditions accelerating the viral expansion of an epidemic unexpectedly inhibit the spread of behaviors. While it is commonly believed that "weak ties"--long-distance connections linking acquaintances--lead to the quicker spread of behaviors, in fact the exact opposite holds true. Centola demonstrates how the most well-known, intuitive ideas about social networks have caused past diffusion efforts to fail, and how such efforts might succeed in the future. Pioneering the use of Web-based methods to understand how changes in people's social networks alter their behaviors, Centola illustrates the ways in which these insights can be applied to solve countless problems of organizational change, cultural evolution, and social innovation. His findings offer important lessons for public health workers, entrepreneurs, and activists looking to harness networks for social change.Practical and informative, How Behavior Spreads is a must-read for anyone interested in how the theory of social networks can transform our world"--Provided by publisher},

	abstract = {Exponential-family Random Graph Models ({ERGMs}) constitute a large statistical framework for modeling sparse and dense random graphs, short- and long-tailed degree distributions, covariates, and a wide range of complex dependencies. Special cases of {ERGMs} are generalized linear models ({GLMs}), Bernoulli random graphs, \${\textbackslash}beta\$-models, \$p\_1\$-models, and models related to Markov random fields in spatial statistics and other areas of statistics. While widely used in practice, questions have been raised about the theoretical properties of {ERGMs}. These include concerns that some {ERGMs} are near-degenerate and that many {ERGMs} are non-projective. To address them, careful attention must be paid to model specifications and their underlying assumptions, and in which inferential settings models are employed. As we discuss, near-degeneracy can affect simplistic {ERGMs} lacking structure, but well-posed {ERGMs} with additional structure can be well-behaved. Likewise, lack of projectivity can affect non-likelihood-based inference, but likelihood-based inference does not require projectivity. Here, we review well-posed {ERGMs} along with likelihood-based inference. We first clarify the core statistical notions of "sample" and "population" in the {ERGM} framework, and separate the process that generates the population graph from the observation process. We then review likelihood-based inference in finite-, super-, and infinite-population scenarios. We conclude with consistency results, and an application to human brain networks},

The underlying assumption is that the social processes represented by the graph configurations without attributes are not homogenous, and the network heterogeneity maybe captured by nodal level exogenous covariates. In this article, we propose {SSMs} for multilevel networks as extensions to exponential random graph models ({ERGMs}) for multilevel networks (Wang et al., 2013). We categorize the proposed model configurations by their similarities in interpretations arising from complex dependencies among ties within and across levels as well as the different types of nodal attributes. The features of the proposed models are illustrated using a network data set collected among French elite cancer researchers and their affiliated laboratories with attribute information about both researchers and laboratories (Lazega et al., 2006, Lazega et al., 2008). Comparisons between the models with and without nodal attributes highlight the importance of attribute effects across levels, where the attributes of nodes at one level affect the network structure at the other level.},

Such models, however, are unable to identify the specific multilevel dependence mechanisms generating the observed network data. This is the basic difference between multilevel analysis of networks and the analysis of multilevel networks. The aim of this article is to show how recently derived multilevel exponential random graph models ({MERGMs}) may be specified and estimated to address the problems posed by the analysis of multilevel networks in organizations.

              Social capital—the strength of an individual’s social network and community—has been identified as a potential determinant of outcomes ranging from education to health
              1–8
              . However, efforts to understand what types of social capital matter for these outcomes have been hindered by a lack of social network data. Here, in the first of a pair of papers
              9
              , we use data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook to study social capital. We measure and analyse three types of social capital by {ZIP} (postal) code in the United States: (1) connectedness between different types of people, such as those with low versus high socioeconomic status ({SES}); (2) social cohesion, such as the extent of cliques in friendship networks; and (3) civic engagement, such as rates of volunteering. These measures vary substantially across areas, but are not highly correlated with each other. We demonstrate the importance of distinguishing these forms of social capital by analysing their associations with economic mobility across areas. The share of high-{SES} friends among individuals with low {SES}—which we term economic connectedness—is among the strongest predictors of upward income mobility identified to date
              10,11
              . Other social capital measures are not strongly associated with economic mobility. If children with low-{SES} parents were to grow up in counties with economic connectedness comparable to that of the average child with high-{SES} parents, their incomes in adulthood would increase by 20\% on average. Differences in economic connectedness can explain well-known relationships between upward income mobility and racial segregation, poverty rates, and inequality
              12–14
              . To support further research and policy interventions, we publicly release privacy-protected statistics on social capital by {ZIP} code at

            This data brief introduces the Friendship and Identity in School ({FIS}) dataset. The {FIS} data are school-based longitudinal social network data, which have become increasingly important in recent years. Including information on 2,500 adolescents in nine secondary schools in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the {FIS} data have four important key features that make them uniquely suited for studying the co-evolution of friendship networks and group identities or other time-varying individual characteristics. Specifically, the data include (i) fine-grained multidimensional measures of youth’ ethnic, national, and religious identities, (ii) comparatively large social networks that span multiple classrooms, (iii) up to six waves over four and a half years, and (iv) an ethnoreligiously diverse sample. Besides friendship and identity, the data include other network dimensions such as romantic relations or dislike as well as repeated measurements of various individual attributes ranging from perceived discrimination over intergroup attitudes and religion to leisure time activities and students’ perceptions of parents’ identities and attitudes. In combination, the {FIS} data provide rich longitudinal information that allows researchers to study the development, change, and interplay of youth’ group identities and friendship networks as well as broader questions concerning intergroup relations, network formation, and peer influence.},

Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 ( Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69\%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31\%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.},

In this article, we investigate why results diverged so much. We argue that the main reason was an unclear research question: Teams differed in their interpretation of the research question and therefore used diverse research designs and model specifications. We show by reanalyzing the data that with a clear research question, a precise definition of the parameter of interest, and theory-guided causal reasoning, results vary only within a narrow range. The broad conclusion of our reanalysis is that social science research needs to be more precise in its “estimands” to become credible.},

The estimand is the target quantity—the purpose of the statistical analysis. Much attention is already placed on how to do estimation; a similar degree of care should be given to defining the thing we are estimating. We advocate that authors state the central quantity of each analysis—the theoretical estimand—in precise terms that exist outside of any statistical model. In our framework, researchers do three things: (1) set a theoretical estimand, clearly connecting this quantity to theory; (2) link to an empirical estimand, which is informative about the theoretical estimand under some identification assumptions; and (3) learn from data. Adding precise estimands to research practice expands the space of theoretical questions, clarifies how evidence can speak to those questions, and unlocks new tools for estimation. By grounding all three steps in a precise statement of the target quantity, our framework connects statistical evidence to theory.},

It offers explanations of the emergence of the state and social stratification; of city-states, militaristic empires, and the persistent interaction between them; of the world salvation religions; and of the particular dynamism of medieval and early modern Europe. It ends by generalizing about the nature of overall social development, the varying forms of social cohesion, and the role of classes and class struggle in history.

At the moment, my generalisations are bolder about agrarian societies; concerning industrial societies I will be more tentative. I define the state and then pursue the implications of that definition.

The author points to the benefits of defining the interaction parameters of a model to have a one-to-one relationship with the odds ratios of interest, thus overcoming problems of interpretation.

	abstract = {Analytical sociology focuses on social interactions among individuals and the hard-to-predict aggregate outcomes they bring about. It seeks to identify generalizable mechanisms giving rise to emergent properties of social systems which, in turn, feed back on individual decision-making. This research program benefits from computational tools such as agent-based simulations, machine learning, and large-scale web experiments, and has considerable overlap with the nascent field of computational social science. By providing relevant analytical tools to rigorously address sociology’s core questions, computational social science has the potential to advance sociology in a similar way that the introduction of econometrics advanced economics during the last half century. Computational social scientists from computer science and physics often see as their main task to establish empirical regularities which they view as “social laws.” From the perspective of the social sciences, references to social laws appear unfounded and misplaced, however, and in this article we outline how analytical sociology, with its theory-grounded approach to computational social science, can help to move the field forward from mere descriptions and predictions to the explanation of social phenomena.},

At the same time, social inequality has markedly increased during the past 40 years, and progress on reducing poverty and improving the life chances of Americans in the bottom half of the distribution has been frustratingly slow. How useful has sociological research been to the task of reducing inequality? The authors analyze the stance taken by sociological research on the subject of reducing inequality. They identify an imbalance in the literature between the discipline’s continual efforts to motivate the plausibility of large-scale change and its lesser efforts to identify feasible strategies of change either through social policy or by enhancing individual and local agency with the potential to cumulate into meaningful progress on inequality reduction.},

Because of this, social network analysis offers many exciting tools and techniques for research and practice in a wide variety of medical and public health situations including organizational improvements, understanding risk behaviors, coordinating coalitions, and the delivery of health care services. This book provides an introduction to the major theories, methods, models, and findings of social network analysis research and application. In three sections, it presents a comprehensive overview of the topic; first in a survey of its historical and theoretical foundations, then in practical descriptions of the variety of methods currently in use, and finally in a discussion of its specific applications for behavior change in a public health context. Throughout, the text has been kept clear, concise, and comprehensible, with short mathematical formulas for some key indicators or concepts. Researchers and students alike will find it an invaluable resource for understanding and implementing social network analysis in their own practice"--Provided by publisher},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}  To examine factors associated with social participation and their relationship with self-perceived well-being in older adults.   {METHODS}  This study was based on data obtained from the National Socioeconomic Characterization ({CASEN}) Survey conducted in Chile, in 2011, on a probability sample of households. We examined information of 31,428 older adults living in these households. Descriptive and explanatory analyses were performed using linear and multivariate logistic regression models. We assessed the respondents’ participation in different types of associations: egotropic, sociotropic, and religious.   {RESULTS}  Social participation increased with advancing age and then declined after the age of 80. The main finding of this study was that family social capital is a major determinant of social participation of older adults. Their involvement was associated with high levels of self-perceived subjective well-being. We identified four settings as sources of social participation: home-based; rural community-based; social policy programs; and religious. Older adults were significantly more likely to participate when other members of the household were also involved in social activities evidencing an intergenerational transmission of social participation. Rural communities, especially territorial associations, were the most favorable setting for participation. There has been a steady increase in the rates of involvement of older adults in social groups in Chile, especially after retirement. Religiosity remains a major determinant of associativism. The proportion of participation was higher among older women than men but these proportions equaled after the age of 80.   {CONCLUSIONS}  Self-perceived subjective well-being is not only dependent upon objective factors such as health and income, but is also dependent upon active participation in social life, measured as participation in associations, though its effects are moderate.

            {OBJETIVO}  Analizar los factores relacionados con la participación en asociaciones y su vínculo con la percepción de bienestar en las personas mayores.   {MÉTODOS}  Se utilizan los datos de la Encuesta Nacional de Caracterización Socioeconómica de Chile del año 2011, basada en una muestra probabilística de los hogares chilenos. Se analizan los datos de 31.428 adultos mayores que viven en dichos hogares. Se realizaron análisis descriptivos y explicativos, utilizando modelos de regresión multivariada logística y lineal. Se distinguieron distintos tipos de participación: egotrópica, sociotrópica y religiosa.   {RESULTADOS}  Los porcentajes de participación en asociaciones aumentaron con la edad hasta los 80 años, para luego descender. El principal hallazgo del estudio consistió en la importancia que tenía el capital social familiar sobre la participación individual de los mayores. Se constató que esta participación se relacionaba con una mayor percepción de bienestar subjetivo. Se identificaron cuatro fuentes de participación social en la vejez: el hogar, el entorno rural, la política social y la religiosidad. Cuando en el hogar había otras personas que participaban se incrementaron significativamente las probabilidades de participar, transmitiéndose además el tipo de asociación en que se participaba. Los entornos rurales eran más propicios para la participación, principalmente de tipo territorial. Las agrupaciones de adultos mayores habían ido en continuo aumento en Chile, siendo más importantes después de la jubilación. La religiosidad seguía siendo una importante fuente de asociativismo. Las mujeres participaban más que los hombres, y sólo se equiparaban a los hombres después de los 80 años.   {CONCLUSIONES}  La percepción de bienestar subjetivo no depende únicamente de las condiciones objetivas de vida de como la salud e ingresos, sino también de una inserción activa en la sociedad, medida como participación en asociaciones, a pesar de que los efectos son moderados.},

Under-and oversocialized accounts are paradoxically similar in their neglect of ongoing structures of social relations, and a sophisticated account of economic action must consider its embeddedness in such structures.

Here we review the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, we discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, as well as the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

The analysis of a national sample survey of China shows that joint channel users, due to their relatively higher level of social capital, not only make more job search attempts but also obtain higher income than formal channel users. Meanwhile, joint channel users, because of their relative advantages in both human capital and social capital, not only make more job attempts but also obtain higher income than informal channel users. The two comparisons offer a new strategy to test the causal role social capital plays in labour market success, regardless of whether social capital is exogenous or endogenous to human capital.},

Effect displays have previously been defined by Fox (1987, 2003) for generalized linear models (including linear models). Such displays are especially compelling for complicated models—for example, those including interactions or polynomial terms. This paper extends effect displays to models commonly used for polytomous categorical response variables: the multinomial logit model and the proportional-odds logit model. Determining point estimates of effects for these models is a straightforward extension of results for the generalized linear model. Estimating sampling variation for effects on the probability scale in the multinomial and proportional-odds logit models is more challenging, however, and we use the delta method to derive approximate standard errors. Finally, we provide software for effect displays in the R statistical computing environment.},

We examine the claims that immigration reduces social cohesion by drawing on the sociological classics to show the forms of cohesion that actually keep modern societies together. This leads to a typology that shows “communitarianism” to be just one such form and one not required, and not necessarily ideal, for the smooth operation of complex organizations and institutions.

	abstract = {Interorganizational relationships connect people affiliated with organizations rather than corporate actors themselves. The managers and owners of organizations therefore do not always control these connections and consequently often cannot profit from them. We discuss the circumstances under which individuals (versus organizations) own these relationships (and therefore also the social capital generated by them). Three factors increase the odds of individual ownership: (a) the extent to which the resources valued by alters belong to the individual (rather than the organization), (b) the degree to which alters feel greater indebtedness to the individual than to the organization, and (c) the extent to which relationships involve emotional attachment. We discuss the implications of the locus of ownership, argue that these distinctions can help explain many results that appear inconsistent on the surface, and call for future research to pay closer attention to these issues.},

This is the backdrop against which people pursue their idiosyncratic interests and objectives, success at which constitutes conversational agency. In principle, agency is made possible by the “looseness” of conversational constraints. This does not create a clear path for the advancement of personal ends, however, since options are always limited by the context, and success is always contingent upon the cooperation of others. Ultimately, the most agentic people are those who readily exploit imperfect options though this means abandoning the inflexible pursuit of pre-conceived objectives.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Support for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 election was widely attributed to citizens who were “left behind” economically. These claims were based on the strong cross-sectional relationship between Trump support and lacking a college education. Using a representative panel from 2012 to 2016, I find that change in financial wellbeing had little impact on candidate preference. Instead, changing preferences were related to changes in the party’s positions on issues related to American global dominance and the rise of a majority–minority America: issues that threaten white Americans’ sense of dominant group status. Results highlight the importance of looking beyond theories emphasizing changes in issue salience to better understand the meaning of election outcomes when public preferences and candidates’ positions are changing.
          , 
            This study evaluates evidence pertaining to popular narratives explaining the American public’s support for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential election. First, using unique representative probability samples of the American public, tracking the same individuals from 2012 to 2016, I examine the “left behind” thesis (that is, the theory that those who lost jobs or experienced stagnant wages due to the loss of manufacturing jobs punished the incumbent party for their economic misfortunes). Second, I consider the possibility that status threat felt by the dwindling proportion of traditionally high-status Americans (i.e., whites, Christians, and men) as well as by those who perceive America’s global dominance as threatened combined to increase support for the candidate who emphasized reestablishing status hierarchies of the past. Results do not support an interpretation of the election based on pocketbook economic concerns. Instead, the shorter relative distance of people’s own views from the Republican candidate on trade and China corresponded to greater mass support for Trump in 2016 relative to Mitt Romney in 2012. Candidate preferences in 2016 reflected increasing anxiety among high-status groups rather than complaints about past treatment among low-status groups. Both growing domestic racial diversity and globalization contributed to a sense that white Americans are under siege by these engines of change.},

The present article is a critical reanalysis of the models offered by Mutz, using the data files released along with her article. Contrary to her conclusions, this article demonstrates that (1) the relative importance of economic interests and status threat cannot be estimated effectively with her cross-sectional data, and (2) her panel data are consistent with the claim that economic interests are at least as important as status threat. The preexisting sociological literature has offered interpretations that incorporate economic interests and, as a result, provides a more credible explanation of the 2016 election.},

Most online social networks involve some specific features, including reciprocity, transitivity and degree heterogeneity. Such networks are so called scale-free networks and have drawn lots of attention in research. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel methodology for directed network embedding within the latent space model ({LSM}) framework. It is known, the link probability between two individuals may increase as the features of each become similar, which is referred to as homophily attributes. To this end, penalized pair-specific attributes, acting as a distance measure, are introduced to provide with more powerful interpretation and improve link prediction accuracy, named penalized homophily latent space models ({PHLSM}). The proposed models also involve in-degree heterogeneity of directed scale-free networks by embedding with the popularity scales. We also introduce {LASSO}-based {PHLSM} to produce an accurate and sparse model for high-dimensional covariates. We make Bayesian inference using {MCMC} algorithms. The finite sample performance of the proposed models is evaluated by three benchmark simulation datasets and two real data examples. Our methods are competitive and interpretable, they outperform existing approaches for fitting directed networks.},

There is further structuration into four age groups: children (3-11 years), youth (12-17 years), young adults (18-45 years), and older adults (46-88 years).

This framework is deployed to analyze how a popular revolt in northeastern Brazil managed to frustrate the Brazilian state’s attempt to implement civil registration in the mid‐19th century. The conclusion considers broad implications of this analysis for students of modern state formation and suggests the need for comparative historical analyses that historicize the naturalization of state power.},

The key issues within the book - sociability, social capital, and community development - are examined in the context of an increasingly aging world population.

            Past research shows that growing inequality often does not result in citizen demands for redistribution. We examine one mechanism that could explain why people do not protest growing inequality: a particular sub-prediction of system justification theory ({SJT}). {SJT} argues that humans have a psychological need to justify their social system. The specific sub-prediction of {SJT} tested here is the idea that inequality itself increases system justification. This could yield a negative feedback loop in which political responses to inequality grows ever less likely as inequality grows more extreme. Previous research on this hypothesis relied on cross-sectional survey data and provided mixed results. We take an experimental approach and ask whether exposure to economic inequality makes people more likely to defend the system. In one main study and two replications with varying samples, experimental treatments, and outcome measures, we find no evidence that information about economic inequality increases system justification motivation.},

            This article investigates how migrant social capital differentially influences individuals’ migration and cumulatively generates divergent outcomes for communities. To combine the fragmented findings in the literature, the article proposes a framework that decomposes migrant social capital into resources (information about or assistance with migration), sources (prior migrants), and recipients (potential migrants). Analysis of multilevel and longitudinal data from 22 rural villages in Thailand shows that the probability of internal migration increases with the available resources, yet the magnitude of increase depends on recipients’ characteristics and the strength of their ties to sources. Specifically, individuals become more likely to migrate if migrant social capital resources are greater and more accessible. The diversity of resources by occupation increases the likelihood of migration, while diversity by destination inhibits it. Resources from weakly tied sources, such as village members, have a higher effect on migration than resources from strongly tied sources in the household. Finally, the importance of resources for migration declines with recipients’ own migration experience. These findings challenge the mainstream account of migrant social capital as a uniform resource that generates similar migration outcomes for different groups of individuals or in different settings. In Nang Rong villages, depending on the configuration of resources, sources, and recipients, migrant social capital leads to differential migration outcomes for individuals and divergent cumulative migration patterns in communities.},

We find that local governments whose constituents are similar politically, in terms of partisanship and voting behavior, are more likely to collaborate with one another in regional planning efforts than those whose constituents are politically diverse.

The proposed method takes sampled ego network data and uses exponential random graph models ({ERGM}) to reconstruct the features of the true, unknown network. After describing the method, the author presents two validity checks of the approach: the first uses the 20 largest Add Health networks while the second uses the Sociology Coauthorship network in the 1990s. For each test, I take random ego network samples from the known networks and use my method to make global network inference. The method successfully reproduces the properties of the networks, such as distance and main component size. The results also suggest that simpler, baseline models provide considerably worse estimates for most network properties. The paper concludes with a discussion of the bounds/limitations of ego network sampling as well as possible extensions to the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Hit songs, books, and movies are many times more successful than average, suggesting that “the best” alternatives are qualitatively different from “the rest”; yet experts routinely fail to predict which products will succeed. We investigated this paradox experimentally, by creating an artificial “music market” in which 14,341 participants downloaded previously unknown songs either with or without knowledge of previous participants' choices. Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success. Success was also only partly determined by quality: The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible.
Access to information about other people's musical choices changes one's own selections, exaggerating the market success of certain songs and introducing uncertainty.

Network concepts provide a supple base for analysis whereby order and regularity are strongly sustained in network neighborhoods but are not necessarily uniform or universal.

            Educational assortative mating and economic inequality are likely to be endogenously determined, but very little research exists on their empirical association. Using census data and log-linear and log-multiplicative methods, I compare the patterns of educational assortative mating in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, and explore the association between marital sorting and earnings inequality across countries. The analysis finds substantial variation in the strength of specific barriers to educational intermarriage between countries, and a close association between these barriers and the earnings gaps across educational categories within countries. This finding suggests an isomorphism between assortative mating and economic inequality. Furthermore, educational marital sorting is remarkably symmetric across gender in spite of the different resources that men and women bring to the union. This study highlights the limitations of using single aggregate measures of spousal educational resemblance (such as the correlation coefficient between spouses’ schooling) to capture variation in assortative mating and its relationship with socioeconomic inequality.},

            Homophily—the tendency for individuals to associate with similar others—is one of the most persistent findings in social network analysis. Its importance is established along the lines of a multitude of sociologically relevant dimensions, e.g. sex, ethnicity and social class. Existing research, however, mostly focuses on one dimension at a time. But people are inherently multidimensional, have many attributes and are members of multiple groups. In this article, we explore such multidimensionality further in the context of network dynamics. Are friendship ties increasingly likely to emerge and persist when individuals have an increasing number of attributes in common? We analyze eleven friendship networks of adolescents, draw on stochastic actor-oriented network models and focus on the interaction of established homophily effects. Our results indicate that main effects for homophily on various dimensions are positive. At the same time, the interaction of these homophily effects is negative. There seems to be a diminishing effect for having more than one attribute in common. We conclude that studies of homophily and friendship formation need to address such multidimensionality further.},

We then specify hypotheses about the impact of resource centralization and dependency, goal ambiguity and technical uncertainty, and professionalization and structuration on isomorphic change.

This article proposes a novel approach to the study of these more extended networks, through the use of data on personal ties in an online social network. We illustrate this method’s potential by describing and explaining the degree of ethnic and gender segregation on Facebook among a representative survey of adolescents in the Netherlands ( N = 2,810; {\textasciitilde}1.1 million Facebook friends). The results show that large online networks are more strongly segregated by ethnicity than by gender. Drawing on the same survey data, we find that core networks are more segregated in terms of ethnicity and gender than are extended networks. However, an exception to this pattern is personal networks of ethnic majority members, whose core networks are as segregated by ethnicity as their extended networks. Further analysis suggests this exception is due to their larger population size and the ethnic segregation of their social settings. We discuss the implications of these findings for the role of structural opportunities, homophily, and balance.},

It is found that there is indeed a positive relationship between the two in this sample. However, the determinants of the two differ: while both strong and weak informal ties in the neighbourhood increase perceived neighbourhood cohesion, only weak ties foster perceived cohesion with the broader community. No effect is found of residents' structural positions within local networks on perceived cohesion beyond the effect of strong and weak ties.

For example, past work has asked if individuals in more socially cohesive neighborhoods have better mental health outcomes. Despite the ubiquity of use, it is relatively rare for contextual studies to use the methods of network analysis. This is the case, in part, because network data are difficult to collect, requiring information on all ties between all actors. In this article the authors ask whether it is possible to avoid such heavy data collection while still retaining the best features of a contextual-network study. The basic idea is to apply network sampling to the problem of contextual models, in which one uses sampled ego network data to infer the network features of each context and then uses the inferred network features as second-level predictors in a hierarchical linear model. The authors test the validity of this idea in the case of network cohesion. Using two complete data sets as a test, the authors find that ego network data are sufficient to capture the relationship between cohesion and important outcomes, such as attachment and deviance. The hope, going forward, is that researchers will find it easier to incorporate holistic network measures into traditional regression models.},

It aims to establish the conditions for the inclusion of neighbors in such a network. Three complementary theoretical perspectives for developing hypotheses are employed: meeting opportunities, sharing groups, and social capital. Arguments are tested using nationally representative data ( N = 902) and multilevel regression models. The results show that all three perspectives contribute to explain the number of neighbor relations in personal networks, although none of the theoretical perspectives is fully confirmed. Interestingly, local facilities such as primary schools and day care facilities, which draw their members not only from the neighborhood but also from a larger local area, influence the likelihood of including neighbors in personal networks: primary schools encourage these relations, while the existence of day care facilities discourages neighboring.},

Three arguments about the community question-that "community" has been "lost," "saved," or "liberated"-are reviewed for their development, network depictions, imagery, policy implications, and current status. The lost argument contends that communal ties have become attenuated in industrial bureaucratic societies; the saved argument contends that neighborhood communities remain as important sources of sociability, support and mediation with formal institutions; the liberated argument maintains that while communal ties still flourish, they have dispersed beyond the neighborhood and are no longer clustered in solidary communities. Our review finds that both the saved and liberated arguments proposed viable network patterns under appropriate conditions, for social systems as well as individuals.},

            This paper studies how social capital is divided across classes in Chile, one of the most unequal countries in the world. We analyse the extent to which upper-, middle-, and lower class individuals congregate in social networks with similar others, while following Bourdieu and expecting that in particular the networks of the higher social strata are segregated in terms of social capital. We test our argument with large-scale, representative survey data for the Chilean urban population aged 18–75 years (n = 2,517) and build an integrated indicator of people’s social class that combines measures of education, occupational class, and household income. Our regression analyses show that upper-class individuals have larger networks and access to more varied and prestigious social resources than their middle- and lower class counterparts. Interestingly, however, we found a U-shaped relationship between social class and class homogeneity, indicating that network segregation is high at the top as well as at the bottom of the class-based social strata. In contrast, the classes in the middle have more heterogeneous class networks, possibly forming an important bridge between the “edges” of the class structure. These findings demonstrate that whereas social and economic capital cumulates in higher classes, the lower classes are socially deprived next to their economic disadvantage.},

This review examines critically a selection of the literature on how physical space affects the formation of social ties. Different aspects of this question have been a feature in network analysis, neighborhood research, geography, organizational science, architecture and design, and urban planning. Focusing primarily on work at the meso- and microlevels of analysis, we pay special attention to studies examining spatial processes in neighborhood and organizational contexts. We argue that spatial context plays a role in the formation of social ties through at least three mechanisms, spatial propinquity, spatial composition, and spatial configuration; that fully capturing the role of spatial context will require multiple disciplinary perspectives and both qualitative and quantitative research; and that both methodological and conceptual questions central to the role of space in networks remain to be answered. We conclude by identifying major challenges in this work and proposing areas for future research.},

To address the research questions, we explored a data set collected from Master of Public Administration ({MPA}) students in four waves over a period of nearly a year. An actor-based model was employed to test various research hypotheses concerning the longitudinal evolution of a friendship network. As a result, we found that (1) salience of demographic attributes does not moderate the relationship between the attributes and friendship ties and (2) age homophily is associated with friendship formation only in the initial stage.},

	abstract = {This study models how new ideas, practices, or diseases spread within and between communities, the diffusion of innovations or contagion. Several factors affect diffusion such as the characteristics of the initial adopters, the seeds; the structure of the network over which diffusion occurs; and the shape of the threshold distribution, which is the proportion of prior adopting peers needed for the focal individual to adopt. In this study, seven seeding conditions are modeled: (1) three opinion leadership indicators, (2) two bridging measures, (3) marginally positioned seeds, and (4) randomly selected seeds for comparison. Three network structures are modeled: (1) random, (2) small-world, and (3) scale-free. Four threshold distributions are modeled: (1) normal; (2) uniform; (3) beta 7,14; and (4) beta 1,2; all of which have a mean threshold of 33\%, with different variances. The results show that seeding with nodes high on in-degree centrality and/or inverse constraint has faster and more widespread diffusion. Random networks had faster and higher prevalence of diffusion than scale-free ones, but not different from small-world ones. Compared with the normal threshold distribution, the uniform one had faster diffusion and the beta 7,14 distribution had slower diffusion. Most significantly, the threshold distribution standard deviation was associated with rate and prevalence such that higher threshold standard deviations accelerated diffusion and increased prevalence. These results underscore factors that health educators and public health advocates should consider when developing interventions or trying to understand the potential for behavior change.},

The group centrality measures will enable researchers to answer such questions as ‘how central is the engineering department in the informal influence network of this company?’ or ‘among middle managers in a given organization, which are more central, the men or the women?’ With these measures we can also solve the inverse problem: given the network of ties among organization members, how can we form a team that is maximally central? The measures are illustrated using two classic network data sets. We also formalize a measure of group centrality efficiency, which indicates the extent to which a group's centrality is principally due to a small subset of its members.},

In such an analysis an explicit account should be taken of the statistical dependence that exists between the quantitative variables and the effects. It is shown that when this is done, the random effect approach and the fixed effect approach yield the same estimate for the slopes, the "within" estimate. Any matrix combination of the "within" and "between" estimates is generally biased. When the "within" estimate is subject to a relatively large error a minimum mean square error can be applied, as is generally done in regression analysis. Such an estimator is developed here from a somewhat different point of departure.},

Attribute variables are included in a directed dependence graph and the Hammersley-Clifford theorem is employed to derive probability models whose parameters can be estimated using maximum pseudo-likelihood. The models are compared to existing network effects models. They can be interpreted in terms of public or private social influence phenomena within groups. The models are illustrated by an empirical example involving a training course, with trainees' reactions to aspects of the course found to relate to those of their network partners.},

We do this through a case study of the convergence of the 1992 Brazilian impeachment movement, which led to the impeachment on corruption charges of President Fernando Collor de Melo. First, we propose a conceptual reformulation of the notion of a ‘civic arena’, based upon the proposition that relationships within political fields are structured by discursive as well as organizational ties, as these are activated over time within particular social settings. Second, we introduce a formal methodology for analyzing the sociocultural structuring of this arena, building upon the algebraic technique of ‘Galois’ or ‘concept’ lattices. We apply the simpler form of lattice analysis — bipartite lattices — to analyze the duality of relations among organizations and their projects. We then incorporate temporality into the analysis by using a new extension of lattice analysis — tripartite lattices — to show the three-way interpenetration among organizations, projects, and events. We argue that this analysis reveals three distinct stages involved in civic coalition formation, as organizations move from sectoral segmentation to cross-sectoral intermingling and finally, civic convergence. These stages, in turn, involve two interrelated sociocultural mechanisms, which we describe as the interanimation and suppression of projects at public events.},

The data consist of observations made by the National Foreign Assessment Center of the Central Intelligence Agency of appearances of Soviet political elites at official and social events for 8 years during the height of the Brezhnev era. Conventional wisdom characterizes the Soviet system as partimonial rather than bureaucratic in nature, that is, a system in which power is exercised through loyalties to key players often rooted in common regional and educational associations. One, therefore, might expect that co-attendance at events over these 8 years to be unrelated to actor’s formal positions and the nature of the events. However, our scaling models reveal that participation is patterned by the state and party offices elites hold. Random graph models provide tests of hypotheses about structural features of this network and confirm the interaction between politicians’ offices and the types of events which they jointly attend. Our discussion of the substantive implications of our analyses highlights the need for more detailed examination of “career tracks” through the co-participation space, particularly deviant career tracks and the need for a companion analysis of the structuring participations by informal power groups like those identified by Willerton [Soviet Stud. 34 (1987) 175].},

A Bayesian estimator based on Gibbs sampling is proposed. The basic model is not identified, because class labels are arbitrary. The resulting identifiability problems are solved by restricting inference to the posterior distributions of invariant functions of the parameters and the vertex class membership. In addition, models are considered where class labels are identified by prior distributions for the class membership of some of the vertices. The model is illustrated by an example from the social networks literature (Kapferer's tailor shop).},

	abstract = {The Internet is a critically important research site for sociologists testing theories of technology diffusion and media effects, particularly because it is a medium uniquely capable of integrating modes of communication and forms of content. Current research tends to focus on the Internet's implications in five domains: 1) inequality (the “digital divide”); 2) community and social capital; 3) political participation; 4) organizations and other economic institutions; and 5) cultural participation and cultural diversity. A recurrent theme across domains is that the Internet tends to complement rather than displace existing media and patterns of behavior. Thus in each domain, utopian claims and dystopic warnings based on extrapolations from technical possibilities have given way to more nuanced and circumscribed understandings of how Internet use adapts to existing patterns, permits certain innovations, and reinforces particular kinds of change. Moreover, in each domain the ultimate social implications of this new technology depend on economic, legal, and policy decisions that are shaping the Internet as it becomes institutionalized. Sociologists need to study the Internet more actively and, particularly, to synthesize research findings on individual user behavior with macroscopic analyses of institutional and political-economic factors that constrain that behavior.},

How are such polls biased? Who is most likely to participate in them? Drawing on a national survey of voter-eligible American adults administered in summer 2016, this paper shows that background characteristics (i.e., age, gender, race, education, and employment status) as well as Internet experiences and skills relate to who casts votes in online political polls.},

Three large-scale performance tests are conducted to reveal the contributions of gender, age, educational level of attainment, Internet experience, and amount of Internet use on both medium- and content-related Internet skills. Age appears to have a negative influence on medium-related skills. However, there is a positive contribution to the level of content-related skills, meaning that older generations perform better than the younger. Unfortunately, they are impeded by their low level of medium-related skills in such a way that the actual result is negative. This noteworthy conclusion, to our knowledge, has hardly received any attention in digital divide research. Educational attainment appears significant for both medium- and content-related Internet skills. This conclusion contrasts somewhat with other research that claims that people learn digital skills more in practice than in formal educational settings. Internet experience only contributes to medium-related skills. It appears that content-related skills do not grow with years of Internet experience and the number of hours spent online weekly. The latter only has some effect on medium-related skills.},

We find that successful social search is conducted primarily through intermediate to weak strength ties, does not require highly connected “hubs” to succeed, and, in contrast to unsuccessful social search, disproportionately relies on professional relationships. By accounting for the attrition of message chains, we estimate that social searches can reach their targets in a median of five to seven steps, depending on the separation of source and target, although small variations in chain lengths and participation rates generate large differences in target reachability. We conclude that although global social networks are, in principle, searchable, actual success depends sensitively on individual incentives.},

Most scholars focus on whether diversity undermines trust, social capital, and collective goods provision. However, the type of prosociality that helps heterogeneous societies function is different from the in-group solidarity that glues homogeneous communities together. Social cohesion in multiethnic societies depends on whether prosocial behavior extends beyond close-knit networks and in-group boundaries. We identify two features of modern societies—social differentiation and economic interdependence—that can set the stage for constructive interactions with dissimilar others. Whether societal adaptations to diversity lead toward integration or division depends on the positions occupied by minorities and immigrants in the social structure and economic system, along with the institutional arrangements that determine their political inclusion.},

            Twenty years after governments across Latin America began implementing neoliberal reforms in earnest, concern is growing about their impact on the quality of democracy in the region. This article examines this issue in the case of Mexico by exploring how patterns of political participation, especially among the rural and urban poor, have changed since the implementation of free market reforms. It asks whether the institutional innovations associated with free market reforms make it easier or more difficult for the poor to participate in Mexico's political process. The answer is not encouraging. Despite democratic openings, the new linkages between the state and citizens established as a result of the transition to a free market development model stifle the voice of the poor not through the threat of force or coercion, but by creating obstacles and disincentives for political mobilization that affect the poor more severely than other groups.},

This article explores the role that community organizations play in mobilizing individuals into three common modes of political participation: voting, protesting, and contacting government. It argues that community organizations help mobilize poor individuals both through the resources they provide for mobilization and because they serve as sites where political parties target individuals for mobilization. It analyzes survey data from {LAPOP} surveys for 18 Latin American countries and finds that overall, poor people are just as politically active as more affluent individuals; that involvement in community organizations is a very strong predictor of all types of political participation; and that membership in organizations has an especially strong effect on voting and protesting for poor people. By equalizing levels of political participation across income groups, organizations help erase class-based inequalities in participation that have plagued democracies in the region.},

              Between 1996 and 2009, a process of struggle for and (after 2002) partial achievement of the second incorporation of the popular sectors took place in Argentina. This process involved a combination of routine and contentious political dynamics that reformulated state-society relations in the postcorporatist period. As a continuation of the first incorporation (1943–55), the second incorporation displayed some similar features; other attributes were specific to this second process, mainly that it was not corporatist but territorial and that the central agents of transformation were not trade unions but the disincorporated popular sectors, which were territorially organized into a “reincorporation movement.” This article conceptualizes these dynamics and analyzes the role played by the main political actor related to this historical process, the

Since “cliques” in social networks have usually been seen informally as sets of individuals more closely tied to each other than to outsiders, {LS} sets provide a natural realization of the “clique” concept. In this paper, it is shown that {LS} sets in social networks have cohesive properties that make them even more useful for empirical analyses. In particular, subgraphs induced by {LS} subsets remain connected even after several edges have been removed. Results bounding the number of edges that can be so removed are used to get an upper bound for the diameter of subgraphs induced by {LS} subsets.},

The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate the same predictions.},

Network density and size influence collective action outcomes in dramatically different ways, depending on the structural position of those who make unconditional contributions. Moreover, these effects are highly nonlinear, suggesting that the impact of social ties on collective action may be quite sensitive to mobilization contexts.},

We also study the role that the recruitment context plays, by comparing the results at these two universities. Independent of the individual background factors, structural position in the multiorganizational field predicts participation in Freedom Summer at Wisconsin, but not at Berkeley. The effects of individual background factors on participation are also contingent on the recruitment context. We discuss the theoretical implications of our results for the study of the effects of multiorganizational fields and recruitment contexts on participation in social movements.},

Thus, efforts to combine the two approaches are rendered unproductive by inevitable inconsistencies of internal logic.

Recent work studies such large online signed networks by applying theories that stem from the notion of social balance. Computing the social balance of a signed network requires counting the distinct configurations of the signed edges within all possible triangles that appear in the network. A naive algorithm for such counting would require time that is cubic to the total number of nodes; such an algorithm is infeasible for large signed networks that are generated from online applications.},

When the two are connected through a third individual as entrepreneur, the gap is filled, creating important advantages for the entrepreneur.

	abstract = {We study the structure of the social graph of active Facebook users, the largest social network ever analyzed. We compute numerous features of the graph including the number of users and friendships, the degree distribution, path lengths, clustering, and mixing patterns. Our results center around three main observations. First, we characterize the global structure of the graph, determining that the social network is nearly fully connected, with 99.91\% of individuals belonging to a single large connected component, and we confirm the "six degrees of separation" phenomenon on a global scale. Second, by studying the average local clustering coefficient and degeneracy of graph neighborhoods, we show that while the Facebook graph as a whole is clearly sparse, the graph neighborhoods of users contain surprisingly dense structure. Third, we characterize the assortativity patterns present in the graph by studying the basic demographic and network properties of users. We observe clear degree assortativity and characterize the extent to which "your friends have more friends than you". Furthermore, we observe a strong effect of age on friendship preferences as well as a globally modular community structure driven by nationality, but we do not find any strong gender homophily. We compare our results with those from smaller social networks and find mostly, but not entirely, agreement on common structural network characteristics.},

Yet research to date does not allow us to determine which dimension, e.g., ethnic, religious, gender, age, or class similarity, drives association. Tests demonstrating homophily are flawed by restricting the range of dimensions in the choice set. We introduce an experimental game in which we exogenously expose subjects to diverse partners to determine which dimension dominates. We find that in a socio-demographically diverse district of Paris, despite expectations of secularization, religious similarity significantly predicts homophily. Moreover, we provide tentative evidence that religious homophily is taste-based. ({JEL} C91, D03, D72, J71, Z12)},

While some researchers suggest that social capital increases with age and others argue the opposite, this study tests these contradictory assertions by analyzing multiple indicators of social capital from a nationally representative data set on working-age U.S. respondents. The findings reveal evidence of both social capital accumulation and decline. Social resources from occupational contacts tend to increase with age, but eventually level off among older respondents. Changes in voluntary memberships follow a similar pattern. However, daily social interaction is negatively associated with age. Overall, the results suggest that social capital embedded in occupational networks tends to accumulate across the career, even in the face of a general decline in sociability. The study also uncovers gender differences in these social capital trajectories that are linked to the distinct life experiences of men and women.},

Understanding different within and between effects is crucial when choosing modeling strategies. The downside of Random Effects ({RE}) modeling—correlated lower-level covariates and higher-level residuals—is omitted-variable bias, solvable with Mundlak's (1978a) formulation. Consequently, {RE} can provide everything that {FE} promises and more, as confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations, which additionally show problems with Plümper and Troeger's {FE} Vector Decomposition method when data are unbalanced. As well as incorporating time-invariant variables, {RE} models are readily extendable, with random coefficients, cross-level interactions and complex variance functions. We argue not simply for technical solutions to endogeneity, but for the substantive importance of context/heterogeneity, modeled using {RE}. The implications extend beyond political science to all multilevel datasets. However, omitted variables could still bias estimated higher-level variable effects; as with any model, care is required in interpretation.},

	abstract = {How can we understand the interaction between the social network topology of a population and the patterns of group affiliation in that population? Each aspect influences the other: social networks provide the conduits via which groups recruit new members and groups provide the context in which new social ties are formed. Given that the resources of individuals are finite, groups can be considered to compete with one another for the time and energy of their members. Such competition is likely to have an impact on the way in which social structure and group affiliation co-evolve. While many social simulation models exhibit group formation as a part of their behaviour (e.g., opinion clusters or converged cultures), models that explicitly focus on group affiliation are less common. We describe and explore the behaviour of a model in which, distinct from most current models, individual nodes can belong to multiple groups simultaneously. By varying the capacity of individuals to belong to groups, and the costs associated with group membership, we explore the effect of different levels of competition on population structure and group dynamics.},

La ponencia presenta un balance crítico del impacto que esas agendas, especialmente ubicadas en la activa política social de los gobiernos de la Concertación (1990 - 2010), han tenido, tanto para la sociedad civil como para la gestión pública. La ponencia analiza los principales mecanismos institucionales de participación ciudadana en políticas públicas desarrollados durante los últimos veinte años en Chile a la luz de su incidencia en la ampliación del espacio público de deliberación democrática. El trabajo postula que la débil institucionalización alcanzada y su desvinculación con el espacio público de deliberación tienen como efecto la reproducción de las desigualdades de acceso a las decisiones públicas y una cierta irrelevancia de los mecanismos implementados en la trayectoria de las políticas. Se proponen estándares básicos que deben cumplirse para que la incorporación de la participación ciudadana redunde en una mayor equidad de acceso, en fortalecimiento de las capacidades de acción pública de la sociedad civil y una mayor efectividad en su articulación a las políticas.},

Se analiza la proveniencia, los canales de acceso, ubicación institucional de las personas provenientes de la sociedad civil y, eventualmente, su trayectoria de salida de posiciones formales de poder político durante el período. Se postula que las restricciones institucionales y el diseño de «elitismo democrático reforzado» de la transición chilena significaron que el amplio estamento de la sociedad civil chilena que accedió al poder político, pertenecía previamente a posiciones privilegiadas dentro de la misma, principalmente al segmento de mayor educación. También reforzó el peso y consolidación de una elite tecnopolítica, especialmente en el poder ejecutivo.},

They are not people at the top of things so much as people at the edge of things, not leaders within groups so much as brokers between groups. The familiar two-step flow of communication is a compound of two very different network mechanisms: contagion by cohesion through opinion leaders gets information into a group, and contagion by equivalence generates adoptions within the group. Opinion leaders as brokers bear a striking resemblance to network entrepreneurs in social capital research. The complementary content of diffusion and social capital research makes the analogy productive. Diffusion research describes how opinion leaders play their role of brokering information between groups, and social capital research describes the benefits that accrue to brokers.]},

Debate between the cohesion and structural equivalence models poses the following question for study: Did the physicians resolve the uncertainty of adopting the new drug through conversations with colleagues (cohesion) or through their perception of the action proper for an occupant of their position in the social structure of colleagues (structural equivalence)? The alternative models are defined, compared, and tested. Four conclusions are drawn: (a) Contagion was not the dominant factor driving tetracyclene's diffusion. Where there is evidence of contagion, there is evidence of personal preferences at work.},

The analysis and visualization of weighted graphs are inherently challenging, and thus it is often of use to only examine edges which are deemed significant. There are several methods for extracting from a weighted graph an unweighted or signed backbone which retains only the significant edges. The backbone package implements four different backbone methods, three of which consider weighted graphs that arise from bipartite projections. This paper describes how to use each of the package's functions and the algorithms they employ.},

The relational properties of tie strength and homophily were employed to examine referral behavior at micro and macro levels of inquiry. The study demonstrates different roles played by weak and strong social ties. At the macro level, weak ties displayed an important bridging function, allowing information to travel from one distinct subgroup of referral actors to another subgroup in the broader social system. At the micro level, strong and homophilous ties were more likely to be activated for the flow of referral information. Strong ties were also perceived as more influential than weak ties, and they were more likely to be utilized as sources of information for related goods.},

Major areas of investigation include sexual experiences such as number of sexual partners in given time periods, frequency of particular practices, and timing of various sexual events. The data cover childhood and adolescence, as well as adulthood. Other topics in the survey relate to sexual victimization, marriage and cohabitation, and fertility. Respondents were also queried about their physical health, including history of sexually transmitted diseases. Respondents' attitudes toward premarital sex, the appeal of particular practices such as oral sex, and levels of satisfaction with particular sexual relationships were also studied.

	abstract = {Social network analysis is used widely in the social and behavioral sciences, as well as in economics, marketing, and industrial engineering. The social network perspective focuses on relationships among social entities and is an important addition to standard social and behavioral research, which is primarily concerned with attributes of the social units. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications reviews and discusses methods for the analysis of social networks with a focus on applications of these methods to many substantive examples. It is a reference book that can be used by those who want a comprehensive review of network methods, or by researchers who have gathered network data and want to find the most appropriate method by which to analyze it. It is also intended for use as a textbook as it is the first book to provide comprehensive coverage of the methodology and applications of the field.},

Why does social class matter more than ever in Britain today? How has the meaning of class changed? What does this mean for social mobility and inequality? In this book Mike Savage and the team of sociologists responsible for the Great British Class Survey look beyond the labels to explore how and why our society is changing and what this means for the people who find themselves in the margins as well as in the centre. Their new conceptualization of class is based on the distribution of three kinds of capital - economic (inequalities in income and wealth), social (the different kinds of people we know) and cultural (the ways in which our leisure and cultural preferences are exclusive) - and provides incontrovertible evidence that class is as powerful and relevant today as it's ever been.},

A series of survey experiments shows that information about whether a person votes directly affects how favorably that person is viewed. Importantly, the study also compares the rewards and sanctions associated with voting to other activities, including the decisions to recycle, volunteer and return one’s library books on time. It presents a behavioral test of the consequences of non-voting and finds that individuals are willing to take costly action in a dictator game to reward political participation. Finally, it shows that survey measures of social norms about voting are correlated with county-level voter turnout. The study adds to the growing literature documenting the important influence of social concerns on turnout and other political choices.},

Disentangling and isolating the unique effects of peer behavior, selection processes, and congruent interests is a challenge for all studies of interpersonal influence. This study proposes and utilizes a carefully designed placebo-controlled experimental protocol to overcome this identification problem. During a face-to-face canvassing experiment targeting households with two registered voters, residents who answered the door were exposed to either a Get Out the Vote message (treatment) or a recycling pitch (placebo). The turnout of the person in the household not answering the door allows for contagion to be measured. Both experiments find that 60\% of the propensity to vote is passed onto the other member of the household. This finding suggests a mechanism by which civic participation norms are adopted and couples grow more similar over time.},

We distinguish between two aspects of this type of utility, intrinsic satisfaction from behaving in accordance with a norm and extrinsic incentives to comply, and test the effects of priming intrinsic motives and applying varying degrees of extrinsic pressure. A large-scale field experiment involving several hundred thousand registered voters used a series of mailings to gauge these effects. Substantially higher turnout was observed among those who received mailings promising to publicize their turnout to their household or their neighbors.

No en vano su aparición, en los años 90, delimitó un campo de conocimiento interdisciplinar y estableció unas líneas de desarrollo futuro que permitieron el despegue definitivo del análisis de las redes sociales, centrado en la identificación y el estudio de estructuras reticulares (relacionales), a menudo emergentes. El libro consta de siete partes, incluido el epílogo, además de un listado de programas informáticos y un conjunto de datos procedentes de investigaciones ya clásicas hoy en día. Las cuatro primeras se corresponden con la materia básica de cursos de introducción al análisis de redes: los tipos de datos reticulares, las formas de representarlos y las medidas de centralidad, cohesión y equivalencia. La quinta parte presenta los métodos para el análisis de díadas y tríadas, y por último la parte sexta presenta modelos estadísticos para el análisis y puesta a pruebas de hipótesis sobre interacciones diádicas. Como afirma José Luis Molina en su introducción: "Cada año aparecen nuevos manuales de redes sociales que leemos con interés y sin embargo el valor de este libro permanece. Una de las razones de esta permanencia es sin duda su capacidad para atraer a las Ciencias Sociales a científicos de otras áreas, que encuentran una introducción comprensible y exhaustiva al mundo de las redes". Esta edición incorpora un valioso glosario de términos en español sobre la materia que, con seguridad, constituirá una referencia académica en su campo.},

	abstract = {"This text demonstrates how to conduct latent variable modeling in R. Techniques that can be analyzed using the free program R are showcased including exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling ({SEM}), latent growth curve modeling, item response theory ({IRT}), and latent class analysis. Easy to follow demonstrations of how to conduct latent variable modeling in R are provided along with descriptions of the major features of the models,their specialized uses, and a full interpretation of the results. Every R command necessary for conducting the analyses is described so readers can directly apply the R functions to their own data. Each chapter features a complete analysis of one or more example datasets including a demonstration of the analysis of the data using R, along with a discussion of relevant theory that includes a full description of the models, the assumptions underlying each model, and statistical details of estimation, hypothesis testing, and more to help readers better understand the models and interpret the results. Some of the examples represent data that is not perfectly "behaved" so as to provide a more realistic view of situations readers will likely encounter with their own data. Detailed explanations of input statements help readers generalize what they learn to their own analyses. Each chapter features an introduction, summary, and exercises involving the application of the model(s), and a list of further readings with an emphasis on related texts that provide more detailed theoretical coverage. A full glossary of the key terms, a cheat sheet that reviews the key R commands, and answers to half of the exercises are provided at the end of the book"--},

	abstract = {Le contact des groupes sociaux réduit les préjugés et les stéréotypes... parfois, et cela dépend de la nature du contact et du cadre. Celui des associations publiques n'a pas été beaucoup exploré, en dépit du fait qu'elles remplissent souvent les conditions nécessaires pour tester l'hypothèse évoquée. Nous étudions une grande association dans laquelle ces conditions peuvent être vérifiées en détail et sont en effet remplies. Nous employons aussi des mesures très évoluées de contact (développées dans l'analyse des réseaux sociaux), de stéréotypes d'áge et de sexe (développées dans la recherche sur les systèmes de croyances), et d'hypothèses élaborées (développées par la théorie de cognition sociale). Aucune forme de contact ne réduit les stéréotypes. Plus d'implication dans une sous-culture renforce en réalité les stéréotypes. Nous montrons que l'attention est une fonction du rang, ce qui fait que nos répondants remarquent l'inégalité caractérisée par une petite élite mais ignorent l'égalité représentée par la vaste majoritè. Les résultats montrent aussi que l'approche cognitive de l'étude des stéréotypes doit être poursuivie en commun avec celle des structures sociales et de leurs implications concernant le contact, les inégalités et l'attention. Contact between social groups reduces prejudice and stereotyping - sometimes, depending on the nature of the contact and the setting. Voluntary association settings have been little explored, though they should often meet the contact hypothesis scope conditions. We analyze a large association in which the conditions can be checked unusually thoroughly and the conditions are met. We also use unusually refined measures of contact (derived from network analysis) and of age and gender stereotyping (derived from work on belief systems) and detailed hypotheses (derived from social cognition theory). No form of contact reduces stereotyping. Greater involvement in the subculture actually increases stereotyping. We argue that attention is a function of rank, so that our respondents notice the inequality of a tiny elite and ignore the equality of the far larger majority. These show results that the cognitive approach to social stereotyping should be combined with work on social structure and its implications for contact, inequality and attention.},

	issn = {00029602, 15375390},
	url = {www.jstor.org/stable/2777006},
	abstract = {After briefly reviewing some general theoretical issues in analyzing systems of social inequality and stratification, we propose a typology of forms of class and status consciousness. A specific procedure employing subjective social distance scales is proposed as an empirical strategy for assessing different forms of status consciousness and exploring their implications for class consciousness and other political and social attitudes. To evaluate the empirical and theoretical utility of this strategy, we report a West German replication of an American study in which substantial evidence is found for a remarkable degree of cross-national similarity in the subjective social distance responses accorded occupations varying in prestige and socioeconomic status, regardless of the class position of the respondent. Some working- and middle-class persons did, indeed, prefer to interact with members of their own class rather than with persons in higher- (or lower-) status occupations; and this manifestation of corporate status consciousness appeared to be specifically linked to other political and social views consonant with such consciousness. But these were relatively minor, albeit systematic, departures from the general picture of prestige-or upward-oriented preferences for intimate interaction at all class levels-what we have called a competitive status consciousness that appeared to be pervasive among lower-status persons in both the American and the German communities studied. While the results can hardly be regarded as definitive, they help to clarify a number of issues in studying subjective consciousness of the class and status order and suggest the promise of further work employing the approach.},

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

This quantitative conception of social structure is the basis for a deductive theory of the macrostructure of social associations in society. The likelihood that people engage in intergroup associations under specifiable structural conditions can bededuced from analaytic propositions about structural properties without any assumption about sociopsychological dispositions to establish intergroup associations, indeed, on the assumption that people prefer ingroup relations. Group size governs the probability of intergroup relations, a fact that has paradoxical implications for discrimination by a majority against a minority. Inequality impedes and heterogeneity promotes intergroup relations. The major structural condition that governs intergroup relations is the degree of connection of parameters. Intersecting parameters exert structural constraints to participate in intergroup relations; consolidated parameters impede them. The more differentiation of any kind penetrates into the substructures of society, the greater is the probability that extensive social relations integrate various segments in society.},

	abstract = {This paper provides operational procedures for coding internationally comparable measures of occupational status from the recently published International Standard Classification of Occupation 1988 ({ISCO}88) of the International Labor Office ({ILO}, 1990). We first discuss the nature of the {ISCO}88 classification and its relationship to national classifications used around the world and also to its predecessor, {ISCO}68 ({ILO}, 1969), which has been widely utilized in comparative research. We argue that comparative research would gain much from adopting {ISCO}88 as the standard tool of classification and provide guidance on how to do this. We then outline the procedures we have used to generate new standard recodes for three internationally comparable measures of occupational status: Treiman's Standard International Occupational Prestige Scale ({SIOPS}), Ganzeboom et al.'s International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status ({ISEI}), and Erikson and Goldthorpe's class categories ({EGP}). To update the {SIOPS} prestige scores we have directly matched the occupational titles in the {SIOPS} scale to the categories of the {ISCO}88 classification. For {ISEI} scores we have replicated the procedure used to create scores for the {ISCO}68 categories, employing the same data but using newly developed matches between the underlying national occupational classifications and {ISCO}88. To construct the {EGP} class codes we have mapped the {ISCO}88 occupation categories into a 10-category classification developed by the {CASMIN} project for a 12-country analysis. To validate these scales, we estimated parameters of a basic status-attainment model from an independent source of data: the pooled file from the International Social Justice Project (a large international data file that combines data from sample surveys in 14 countries). Estimates based on occupational status scales derived from {ISCO}88 and {ISCO}68 are highly similar.},

Although network analysis has been increasingly used to uncover patterns among social relationships, theoretical explanations of these patterns have been inadequate. This paper presents a theory of the social organization of friendship ties. The approach is based upon Homans's concepts of activities, interactions, and sentiments and upon the concept of extra-network foci organizing social activities and interaction. The theory is contrasted with Heider's balance theory. Implications for transitivity, network bridges, and density of personal networks are discussed and presented as propositions. The focus theory is whosn to help explain patterns of friendships in the 1965-66 Detroit Area Study. This paper is intended as a step toward the development of integrated theory to explain interrelationships between networks and other aspects of social structure. Inplications for data analysis are discussed.},

Do minority groups are less trusting than the dominant group in a society? Do immigrants adapt to the trust levels of their host countries and do patterns of residence shape faith in others? Does interaction with people in groups build trust? Does the welfare state promote trust and in turn does trust lead to greater well-being and to better health outcomes? There are also essays on the foundations of political trust, political trust and the economy and elections. There are essays linking trust to the law, corruption, tax compliance, and economic growth. Authors also discuss how trust shapes cooperation in the international system and how it shapes attitudes toward international institutions and foreign countries"--},

High-status culture is correlated with class but excluded, not used, in the competitive private sector. The most widely useful cultural resource is cultural variety, and social network variety is a better source of cultural variety than is class itself.},

La sociedad chilena, en cambio, se caracteriza por tener umbrales de confianza social muy bajos, que resienten toda la estructura de relación con extraños. La debilidad asociativa que resulta de ello se compensa, sin embargo, con la fortaleza y densidad que adquieren las relaciones entre conocidos, cuyo fundamento se encuentra en el espacio de las relaciones familiares y que definen, por contraste con el modelo de la ‘asociatividad’ norteamericano, el modelo de la ‘sociabilidad’ que es propio de nuestra sociedad.},

The paper first goes on to describing the main agendas of social participation included within the social policies that have been implemented during the process of transition to democracy. Then we examine the public policy networks that have reached incidence at the local and national level. It is argued that despite the fact that these networks have not produced a new political actor, they show novel forms of local political action. How­ ever, these networks are still limited in their impacts, which can be explained due to three main issues: endogenous factors, the fact that they are relatively disconnected from the current political practices and the failures of the institutional design of the agendas for social participation that have prevailed in the country.},

	shorttitle = {¿Reforma del Estado o cambio en la matriz socio-política?},
	abstract = {{RESUMEN}: El trabajo propone replantear el tema de la reforma del Estado de modo de considerar las diversas dimensiones de éste, desde su aspecto de dominación hasta su aspecto de agente de unidad, integración y desarrollo, y sus relaciones con otros dos componentes de lo que se denomina matriz socio-política, que son, además del Estado, la estructura político-partidaria o sistema de representación y la base social o sociedad civil. Este esquema conceptual se desarrolla a partir de una constatación del déficit teórico sobre el tema del Estado, dado el fracaso de las teorías marxistas, neo-liberales o instrumentalistas del Estado. Una vez descrita la matriz clásica, en términos de la fusión o imbricación de sus componentes en torno al eje político partidario, y de un modelo de agregación del aparato estatal, se examina la desarticulación producida en ella por el régimen militar. Ello a través de la reducción del Estado con la pérdida de sus funciones integrativas, redistributivas y de desarrollo y de la expansión de su función coercitiva; la virtual eliminación del sistema de representación y la consagración de los mecanimos de mercado como formas casi exclusivas de constitución de la sociedad civil. A continuación se estudia como el tema de la reforma del Estado ha sido planteado bajo el régimen democrático inaugurado en 1990, a partir de la doble tarea a éste planteada: superación de la herencia institucional autoritaria e inicio de las tareas de democratización social como parte del proceso de consolidación democrática. Se examinan las diversas medidas que tienen que ver con las diversas funciones del Estado. Se concluye que se han logrado grandes avances tanto en el plano político, pero sin haber superado los enclaves institucionales, como en el plano socio-económico, pero sin haberse establecido un sistema de bienestar social compatible con el crecimiento que incluya modificaciones estructurales e institucionales. Se afirma que la reforma del Estado, en la perspectiva planteada en este trabajo, con su implicación para la recomposición de la matriz socio-política, no fue planteada globalmente como objetivo específico, sino que abordada en dimensiones particulares, por lo que queda como tarea pendiente. Finalmente, se plantean las diversas dimensiones de una reforma del Estado hacia el futuro en la perspectiva de un fortalecimiento autónomo y complementario de los tres componentes de la matriz socio-política y se estudian las implicaciones que ello tiene para el Estado mismo, en el sentido de recomposición del aparato estatal y de superación del modelo de agregación por el de transformación interna en términos de sus funciones, dimensiones, e inserción en la matriz socio-política.{ABSTRACT}: The article proposes to rethink the role of the State reform taking into account the different dimensions of this, from its aspect of domination to its role as an agent of unity, integration and development, and also the relations of the State with two other components of what it has been called sociopolitical matrix, the political-party structure or system of representation, and the civil base or civil society. The authors also emphasize the failure of the Marxist, Neoliberal or Instrumentalist Theories in order to explain the new performance of the State. Once described the classical matrix, the article analizes the desarticulation produced by the military regime through the reduction of State functions such as integration, redistribution, development and representation, and improving anothers ones such as coertion and market distorsions. After 1990, the new democratic regime constituted in Chile has planned to reform the State in two orders: first, surpassing the authoritarian institutional heritage, and second, beginning the social democratization as part of a deeper process of democratic consolidation. The outcomes of this process of reform have been very positive, hut still persist some institutional and socioeconomic enclaves. Although this reform has not been outlined from a global perspective, it has been developed in some particular dimensions. Finally, Garretón and Espinosa pose the different aspects of a State Reform in a close future, underlying an autonomous and complementary strength of the three components of the sociopolitical matrix and studying the consequences for the State itself, in the sense of a recomposition of its apparatus and surpassing the agregation model for one of a complete transformation},

These years correspond to the shift in hegemonic models of development in the region, from import-substitution industrialization to neoliberal “open markets” adjustment. We examine how the application of the new policies correlates with change patterns in four areas: urban systems and urban primacy; urban unemployment and informal employment; poverty and inequality; and crime, victimization, and urban insecurity. We present detailed analyses of each of these topics based on the latest available data for the six countries. We conclude that significant changes in patterns of urbanization have taken place in the region, reflecting, in part, the expected and unexpected consequences of the application of the new model of development. Implications of our findings for each of the four areas examined and for the future of the region are discussed.},

	abstract = {"Exponential random graph models ({ERGMs}) are a class of statistical models for social networks. They account for the presence (and absence) of network ties and so provide a model for network structure. An {ERGM} models a given network in terms of small local tie-based structures, such as reciprocated ties and triangles. A social network can be thought of as being built up of these local patterns of ties, called network configurations xe "network configurations", which correspond to the parameters in the model. Moreover, these configurations can be considered to arise from local social processes, whereby actors in the network form connections in response to other ties in their social environment. {ERGMs} are a principled statistical approach to modeling social networks. They are theory-driven in that their use requires the researcher to consider the complex, intersecting and indeed potentially competing theoretical reasons why the social ties in the observed network have arisen. For instance, does a given network structure occur due to processes of homophily xe "actor-relation effects:homophily", xe "homophily" {\textbackslash}t "see actor-relation effects" reciprocity xe "reciprocity", transitivity xe "transitivity", or indeed a combination of these? By including such parameters together in the one model a researcher can test these effects one against the other, and so infer the social processes that have built the network. Being a statistical model, an {ERGM} permits inferences about whether, in our network of interest, there are significantly more (or fewer) reciprocated ties, or triangles (for instance), than we would expect"--},

	abstract = {El rasgo común a los seis ensayos que componen este volumen es el deseo de formular una teoría del urbanismo capaz de dar cuenta de la forma en que la ciudad (la planificación urbana) refleja la desigualdad social, contribuye a reproducirla o incluso la refuerza y profundiza. Así, son cuatro los tipos de problemas a los que se enfrenta el autor: problemas teóricos, de categorización del hecho urbano, problemas de conceptualización del espacio, problemas de definición de la desigualdad social (¿existe una justicia social territorial?) y, por último, problemas concernientes a la naturaleza de la teoría y práctica del urbanismo. Ahora bien, si bien los seis ensayos reflejan una misma preocupación teórica, su problemática se va transformando, mostrando una trayectoria que arranca de planteamientos "liberales" para llegar a planteamientos socialistas. Así, desde el primer ensayo hasta el último asistimos a la transformación del horizonte teórico del autor, al que la necesidad de explicar las relaciones entre desigualdad social y estructura urbana obliga a recurrir a los conceptos del análisis materialista marxiano: valor de uso y valor de cambio, excedente y plusvalor. Hasta concluir: "De la historia hemos heredado un urbanismo basado en la explotación ... Queda para la teoría revolucionaria explorar el camino que va de un urbanismo basado en la explotación a un urbanismo apropiado para la especie humana. Y queda para la práctica revolucionaria llevar a cabo tal transformación."},

Las categorías del análisis remiten a cuatro familias de acción colectiva: acción reivindicativa, participación institucional, acción comunitaria y lógica de ruptura. El artículo muestra que las características del movimiento social en los períodos analizados corresponden a articulaciones particulares de estas orientaciones a la acción. El período de las primeras ocupaciones de terrenos está dominado por una lógica puramente reivindicativa, que subordina la participación institucional y se apoya en la comunidad. En el período de la promoción popular la iniciativa institucional y política se articula con la organización comunitaria, a la vez que intenta canalizar la acción lógica reivindicativa, mientras que esta última se vincula con acciones rupturistas. Durante la Unidad Popular el movimiento está dominado por la asociación de una lógica reivindicativa y la mantención de la institucionalización, cuya expresión típica son los campamentos. La acción comunitaria pasa a un segundo plano, mientras que la lógica de ruptura no se articula con los elementos anteriores. La acción de los pobladores en los 80 se organiza sobre la base de la crisis de la acción reivindicativa y la institucionalización; la prioridad otorgada a los sentimientos comunitarios se acerca, de manera minoritaria pero real, a las fuerzas de ruptura},

La hipótesis que se buscará demostrar es que dichas movilizaciones, si bien representan una lucha social contra el desplazamiento de los pobres hacia la periferia urbana, no pueden ser comprendidas sin considerar la lucha contra la dominación que las orienta. Como perspectiva teórica, se utilizará el concepto de justicia desarrollado por Rainer Forst (2015), el cual supone tanto una dimensión social como política.},

En los períodos de menor actividad, sin embargo, parece que los pobladores hubieran poco menos que desaparecido. Esta discontinuidad en la acción colectiva de los pobladores es una constante histórica que debe tomarse en cuenta para su definición como actor social. A lo largo del siglo veinte, los conflictos urbanos han estado presentes en todas las décadas, por cierto con muy diversas características, culminando con las protestas urbanas de 1983 85 (Espinoza 1988, Campero 1987, Castells 1983). Esta regularidad del conflicto urbano lleva a preguntarse cuál es la posición del conflicto en el contexto de la acción colectiva, antes que reducir los movimientos sociales a la presencia o ausencia de conflictos...},

I pay particular attention to the theory and measurement of voluntary associations in promoting trust, hypothesizing that voluntary associations connected to other voluntary associations are more beneficial for the creation of generalized trust than associations isolated from other associations. The theory is tested with a multi-level, cross-national model, including both individual-level and country-level variables to predict the placement of trust. At the individual level, I find that membership in connected associations creates more trust than membership in isolated associations. At the national level, having more connected voluntary associations increases trust, while having more isolated associations decreases trust.},

The chapter also introduces new theory that combines the two most common distinctions—bridging versus bonding associations and connected versus isolated associations. The end of the chapter documents how each of the theories and mechanisms have been supported, challenged, or neglected in existing empirical evidence and concludes with recommendations for how to test theories on trust and participation moving forward.},
